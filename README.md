**Agentic AI Developer | Cloud-Native Engineer | Hackathon Technical Lead**

*I build autonomous AI systems that don't just chat — they act.*

## What I Do

I'm an **Agentic AI Developer** at Panaversity, specializing in autonomous AI systems, cloud-native architecture, and specification-driven development. I recently completed **6 progressive hackathons** — going from a file watcher to a full Kubernetes-orchestrated platform with Constitutional AI, event-driven microservices, and a Discord bot — all in one system.

**Right Now:**
- Building production AI systems with real-world agency (Kubernetes, Kafka, Dapr)
- Exploring Constitutional AI safety mechanisms and Human-in-the-Loop workflows
- Developing multi-interface applications (Web + Discord from a single API)
- Writing about agentic AI, spec-driven development, and cloud-native patterns

## Flagship Project

### [Hackathon Completion Engine](https://github.com/asadullah48/hackathon-completion-engine) — Cloud-Native AI Todo System

[![H4 Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/H4-platinum%20tier-blue)]()
[![H4.5 Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/H4.5-discord%20bot-purple)]()
[![Tests](https://img.shields.io/badge/tests-180%2B%20passing-brightgreen)]()
[![K8s Services](https://img.shields.io/badge/k8s%20services-14-orange)]()

A **production-grade, Kubernetes-orchestrated application** built progressively across 6 hackathons (H0-H4.5), featuring Constitutional AI safety, event-driven microservices, and a Discord bot interface.

**Tech:** FastAPI, Next.js 14, PostgreSQL, Apache Kafka (Strimzi KRaft), Dapr, Redis, Prometheus, Kubernetes, discord.py, GitHub Actions CI/CD

**What Makes It Different:**
- **Constitutional AI Middleware** — Blocks homework-solving queries with Socratic responses, flags edge cases for human review
- **Zero-Code Infra Swap** — Switched pub/sub from Redis to Kafka by changing 1 YAML file (Dapr abstraction)
- **14 K8s Services in 6GB** — Full production stack at 44% memory utilization on Minikube
- **Event-Driven Audit Trail** — Every interaction published to Kafka (chat, todo, system events) with 24h retention
- **Multi-Interface** — Same backend serves both a Next.js frontend and a Discord bot (TodoMaster AI)

<summary><b>Hackathon Progression (Bronze to Platinum)</b></summary>

| Hackathon | Project | Tier | What I Built | Tests |
|-----------|---------|------|-------------|-------|
| **H0** | Personal AI CTO | Bronze | File watcher, auto-categorization, HITL approvals | 7/7 |
| **H1** | Course Companion | Silver | FastAPI backend, Constitutional AI filter, conversation tracking | - |
| **H2** | AI-Powered Todo | Silver | Spec-driven development, AI spec generation, CRUD with constitution | - |
| **H3** | Advanced Todo | Gold | Event-driven architecture, Kafka, Dapr, team collaboration, recurring todos | 149/149 |
| **H4** | Cloud-Native | Platinum | Full Kubernetes cluster (14 manifests), CI/CD, Prometheus monitoring | - |
| **H4.5** | Discord Bot | Extended | TodoMaster AI with 6 slash commands, K8s deployment | 31/31 |

**Result: 5/5 hackathons completed + extended Discord bot integration**

## Learning Philosophy

> "Traditional approach: Avoid AI mistakes.
> My approach: **Learn FROM AI mistakes.**
> Because real innovation happens at the edges of failure."

**I believe in:**
- **Spec-First Development** — Clear specifications before code
- **Iterative Learning** — Embracing mistakes as data points
- **AI as Collaborator** — Not just a tool, but a thinking partner
- **Production Quality** — Every project deployment-ready
- **Open Source** — Sharing knowledge to elevate the community
